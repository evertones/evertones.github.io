# website Repository

## Description:
  This is a very simple website built with basic web technologies like HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript and PHP (send e-mail). 
  The goal is to have a responsive webpage to present personal information in an organized and "easy to use" way, going beyond information stored on Linkedin (for example).
