# website
This is a website built with basic web technologies like HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript and PHP. 
The objective is to have a responsive webpage to present personal information in an organized and "easy to use" way, going beyond information stored on Linkedin (for example).

The website is my initial project on Github, wich I used to test it. 
It is published under evertones.org.

I want to add some features, like internationalization, although I am not sure when I am going to do it.
